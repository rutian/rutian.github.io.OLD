title: Presentation Timer (2 of 2) // Wall Servo
---

Two part demo for [Critical Making](http://make.berkeley.edu) 

A presentation timer that disconnects the presenter from the projector when time is up. A 'Desk Clock' is used to set and start the countdown time, and has a 7 segment display for the countdown. A 'Wall Servo' presses the input channel selector located on the whiteboard. As a demo of wifi networking, the two devices communicate state information through a server.
